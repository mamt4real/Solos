# Solo Exercises on Java

## Desceiption

A while back durring the covid-19 lockdown I and My Friend @IySheme agreed to start solving coding challenges one a day with either of Java or Python.
Although we werent able to do much, this repo contains some of the java implementations i did.

Disclaimer: I wasnt able to recover the questions and a lot of poor commenting then, but im still proud of these. As it was my first time learning programming...üòÅ
